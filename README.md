## Contents

We explored a small part of SLAM using a turtlebot3. This repository includes few SLAM topics like EKF slam, RGB-D slam and Frontier exploration.

- EKF as an algorithm is very useful in many problems. So, we explored it in its original form. Check [this](https://github.com/AakinDesai/ME-499/tree/master/Extended%20Kalman%20Filter) for the implementation of EKF in C++.

- Implemented EKF slam from scratch.

- Implemented RTAB-Map on a turtlebot3

- Implemented Frontier exploration on a turtlebot3.

Clone the repository and follow the [readme file](https://github.com/AakinDesai/ME-499/blob/master/slam/README.md) for more info about how to execute each of the above slam techniques.
